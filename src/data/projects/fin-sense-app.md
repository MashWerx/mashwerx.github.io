## The Challenge
FinSense needed a mobile experience that matched their web platform's depth but with the speed of a native app. Security and real-time data visualization were paramount.

## The Solution
Mashwerx utilized **Flutter** to deploy a single codebase to both iOS and Android. We integrated:
* Biometric authentication (FaceID/TouchID).
* Real-time WebSocket data streams for stock tracking.
* Local caching for offline access.

## The Result
A 4.8-star average rating on the App Store and a 30% increase in daily active users within three months.
