## The Challenge
Logistics One was losing revenue due to overstocking and understocking. Human forecasting was too slow for their market speed.

## The Solution
We built a custom **Python/TensorFlow** model trained on 5 years of their historical data.
* Automated purchasing orders based on predictive trends.
* Integration with existing ERP systems via API.
* Dashboard for manual overrides and reporting.

## The Result
Inventory waste reduced by 22% in the first quarter, saving the client over $150k annually.
